        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I was born in Australia but moved to Cary, NC at the young age of 3. I grew up all my life in Cary and when
          it came down to go to college I decided to pursue a film degree at UNC Wilmington.

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p> I've got a few different hobbies but first and foremost is my love for video games. I grew up as an only child
        so I've spent a lot of time by myself. Video games were something I could do alone but also cultivate my critical thinking
        skills as well as social interaction. I found myself becoming a leader at a young age with these online games so this eventually
        translated to one of my other passions which is basketball.</p>
           <br>
           <p>
          Basketball is another passion I have and I have been playing consistenly since roughly age 12. Previously I was playing soccer
          but I discovered that I was so much better at the sport of basketball. Over the past 5 or 6 years I have been playing 3 times a
          week with an absolute stellar group of guys ranging in age from early 20s to late 40s. I credit these guys a lot with helping me
          grow and teaching me some valuable life lessons.</p>
           <br>
           <p>
          One of my other big hobbies is film and television. Since I have a film degree, I consider myself a big critic when it comes
            this medium. When I was younger I was a bit of an amateur film maker and my friends and I recieved a lot of great feedback
            from family and friends. Since I consider myself a very observant person, I believe this goes hand and hand with critiquing
            film and TV.
